# 🐍 100 Days of Python - Learning Journey

Welcome to my **100 Days of Python** repository! This is a comprehensive collection of Python projects documenting my journey from beginner to advanced levels, with a focus on building a strong foundation for data science.

## 📚 About This Journey

This repository represents my commitment to learning Python through hands-on projects. Each project is designed to teach specific concepts, from basic programming fundamentals to more advanced topics that are essential for data science. Whether you're just starting your Python journey or looking to strengthen your skills, you'll find projects that challenge and inspire.

### Learning Path
- **Beginner**: Basic syntax, data types, control flow, functions
- **Intermediate**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), file handling, APIs
- **Advanced**: Data structures, algorithms, data manipulation
- **Data Science Preparation**: Projects that build skills needed for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning

## 🎯 Project Categories

This repository contains a diverse collection of Python projects organized by category:

### 🎮 Game Development Projects
Interactive games that teach game logic, user interaction, and control flow. These projects cover card games, word games, number guessing games, and more.

### 🧮 Utility & Calculator Projects
Practical tools and calculators that demonstrate mathematical operations, user input handling, and real-world problem-solving.

### 🔐 Security & Encryption Projects
Projects focused on data security, encryption algorithms, and secure password generation techniques.

### ☕ Real-World Applications
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) projects that simulate real-world systems and applications, teaching design patterns and code organization.

### 🎨 Turtle Graphics Projects
Creative visual projects using Python's Turtle graphics library. These projects explore drawing, patterns, animations, and artistic visualizations.

### 📝 Quiz & Data Projects
Interactive quiz applications and data handling projects that demonstrate OOP principles, data structures, and user interaction systems.
